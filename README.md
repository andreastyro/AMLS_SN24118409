AMLS Report

The files are organized as such. Each letter folder contains two python files, the Task_X.py files, were they solve the task on their own and the Model_CNN.py files that have a refactored version of the code that can be imported to the main.py file. Moreover, the main.py file imports the BreastMNIST_CNN.py and BloodMNIST_CNN.py files to use. The datasets folder contains a .gitkeep file in order to be pushed to the repository as empty directories cannot exist in GitHub.

The packages required to run the code are torch, torchvision, medmnist, matplotlib, sys and pathlib.



Clarification: The commit history has been simulated to match the tasks order and methodology taken, as this repository was created just for submission purposes. The implementation of both tasks was a long and arduous process, so the dates on the commit history are not the true ones. Conventional commits were used to understand the order of the process.
